.flask
Purpose: Used to build web applications.
In your project: Creates the user interface (UI) to collect user inputs and display predicted traffic volume

.numpy
Purpose: Supports numerical operations, especially for arrays and math functions.
In your project: Converts user inputs to NumPy arrays for model prediction

.pandas
Purpose: Handles data loading, cleaning, and transformation using DataFrames.
In your project: Reads the CSV file, preprocesses features, and creates input for ML model

.scikit-learn
purpose: Machine learning library with tools for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.
In your project:
RandomForestRegressor for training your prediction model.
train_test_split to split dataset.
mean_squared_error for evaluation.

.matplotlib
purpose: Used for plotting graphs and charts.
In your project: Visualizes traffic trends and predictions.

.seaborn
Purpose: Built on matplotlib for more beautiful and informative visualizations.
In your project: Correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and trend graphs.


.joblib
Purpose: Saves and loads trained machine learning models.
In your project: Used to save the .pkl model file (model.pkl) for Flask to use
