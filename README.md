# 🚦 TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation

**TrafficTelligence** is a full-stack machine learning web application that predicts traffic volume based on real-world features such as weather conditions, date, and time. This project leverages historical traffic and weather data, powerful regression models, and an interactive web interface to provide users with accurate traffic forecasts. It is particularly useful for city planners, transportation agencies, logistics companies, and commuters who want to anticipate traffic congestion.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- Predicts traffic volume for any date, time, and weather condition.
- Uses machine learning (Random Forest/XGBoost) for high-accuracy forecasting.
- Provides an interactive web interface built using Flask and HTML/CSS.
- Accepts real-time input parameters including weather description, temperature, rain, and time.
- Visualizes and analyzes the relationships between features and traffic trends (optional enhancements).

## 📊 Dataset Overview

**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Metro Interstate Traffic Volume](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)

**Description:**
This dataset contains hourly traffic volume data from a major highway in Minneapolis, collected alongside weather attributes. It's ideal for regression-based predictive modeling.

**Key Features Used:**

| Feature             | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `date_time`         | Timestamp of the record              |
| `temp`              | Temperature in Kelvin                |
| `rain_1h`           | Rainfall amount in mm                |
| `snow_1h`           | Snowfall amount in mm                |
| `clouds_all`        | Cloud coverage in percentage         |
| `weather_main`      | Main weather category                |
| `weather_description` | Detailed weather description      |
| `traffic_volume`    | Target variable (vehicles/hour)      |

## 💡 Machine Learning Model

### Steps:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - Converted `date_time` into `hour`, `day`, `month`, and `weekday`
   - One-hot encoded categorical features (`weather_description`)
   - Normalized numeric features where necessary

2. **Model Training**
   - Models: `RandomForestRegressor`, `XGBoostRegressor`
   - Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, and R² Score
   - Selected the best model and saved it using `joblib` as `model/model.pkl`

3. **Performance (Example)**
   - R² Score: 0.88
   - RMSE: 460

## 🌐 Web Application

Built with **Flask** for the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend.

### Features:
- User-friendly input form
- Input: Date, time, weather description, temperature, rain, snow, clouds
- Output: Predicted hourly traffic volume
- Responsive design for better accessibility
